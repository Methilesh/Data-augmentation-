# Data Augmentation using Deep Learning with Keras

This repository provides a Python implementation for data augmentation using deep learning techniques with the Keras library. Data augmentation is a crucial step in training deep learning models, as it helps increase the diversity and size of the training dataset, which in turn can improve model generalization and performance. This README will guide you through the setup, usage, and customization of the data augmentation techniques provided in this repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image data augmentation)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install keras numpy opencv-python
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-augmentation-keras.git
```

2. Change the directory to the repository's root:

```bash
cd data-augmentation-keras
```

3. You are now ready to use the data augmentation techniques in your deep learning project.

## Usage

In this repository, we provide several data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning for various data types (primarily focused on image data). You can use these techniques by importing the relevant module and applying them to your dataset. For example, to perform image data augmentation using rotation, flipping, and scaling:

```python
from data_augmentation import image_augmentation

# Load your dataset
data = ...  # Load your dataset here

# Apply data augmentation
augmented_data = image_augmentation(data, rotation_range=20, horizontal_flip=True, vertical_flip=False, zoom_range=(0.8, 1.2))
```

Each data augmentation module contains detailed documentation on its usage, parameters, and examples in the respective Python files.
