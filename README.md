# Data-augmentation-

Data augmentation in a Keras project involves applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase the diversity of training images, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

Keras provides tools like the ImageDataGenerator class to easily implement data augmentation techniques for image datasets during the training process.
